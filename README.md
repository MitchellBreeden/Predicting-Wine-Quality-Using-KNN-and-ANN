## Project Overview
- **Title:** Predicting Wine Quality Using KNN and ANN
- **Authors:** Mitchell Breeden, An Major, Dedelolia Olungwe, Gregory Tress
- **Course:** AIT-736-003
- **Institution:** George Mason University
- **Date:** August 19, 2023

## Project Description
Objective: To predict wine quality using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based on physiochemical properties.

## Data Sources
- Dataset including various physiochemical properties of wine.

## Methodology
- **Tools Used:** [List specific tools]
- **Features:** Analysis of wine properties such as acidity, sugar level, etc.
- **Approach:** Implementing KNN and ANN for predictive modeling.
- **Notes:** [Additional methodology notes]

## Results and Conclusions
- Assessment of model accuracy in wine quality prediction.
- Comparative analysis of KNN and ANN models.
